# PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge: Rachael Muturi

## üíºProject Description

This is my personal portfolio website, created as a submission for the PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge Hackathon. The website is built using only vanilla HTML and CSS, showcasing my graphic design projects, skills, and professional background.

As a graphic designer, I have leveraged my design principles to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio. The site is a static, multi-page website that is easy to navigate and provides a clear overview of my work and profile.

## üìåKey Features

The portfolio includes the following sections as required by the hackathon guidelines:

- **About Me:** A brief introduction to my professional background and passion.
- **Skills:** A list of my proficiencies, including my programming languages (HTML, CSS) and design tools.
- **Educational Background:** Details of my academic journey and a link to my downloadable CV.
- **Interests:** A look into what motivates me in the tech and design world.
- **Projects:** A showcase of my graphic design work, with dedicated pages for each project.
- **Contact Me:** A simple contact form for collaborators and employers to reach out.
